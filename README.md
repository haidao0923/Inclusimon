# Inclusimon
Simon game created in 2 days for HackTheNorth.
The purpose of this project is to experiment with new and innovative ways to tackle the lack of accommodations for disabled gamers. The main goal of this project is to give a few possible solutions to how games could be redesign with accessibility in mind.

Throughout the creation of this project, I was able to learn about how different people have try to make the competition more fair for disabled player in other fields such as soccer and basketball, but in doing so, lead to segregation into male and female and able vs disable group.
My hope is that as I create more applications and do more research involving accessibilities, I will be able to create a permanent solution to help the disabled community without having to resort to the current accepted practice of segregation.
